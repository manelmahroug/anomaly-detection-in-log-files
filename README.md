# anomaly-detection-in-log-files

Computer-generated records, commonly known as logs, capture timestamped data as it relates to actions and decisions taken by applications, operating systems and devices. Businesses leverage this data to ensure that their applications and tools are fully operational and secure.
In this project, and as part of our Capstone project for the Master of Applied Data Science, will explore anomaly detection in application log data. This will be done similarly to the paper **Anomaly Detection for Application Log Data[1]**, but our approach will use _generalized feature extraction_ without using any log file specific custom coding.

The question we will explore is how well this generalized feature extraction works. That is, how do models trained on the generalized feature extraction output compare to models trained on the output of customized feature extraction.
